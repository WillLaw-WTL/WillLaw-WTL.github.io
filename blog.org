*** Who Do I Want to be in Five Years?
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_DATE: 2019-07-20
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: fiveyears
:END:
Until today I didn't have an answer.

I didn't have a clear idea of what I was working towards in life. What did I want to acheive, what kind of person did I want to become? It felt like I was lost, driving without a destination.

I spent some time introspecting, here's my answer:

/In five years I want to be the guy you go to if you have an awesome idea and need it built. I want to build something that’s impactful and interesting technically. Right now I don’t generate great ideas, so the best way to find something meaningful to work on seems to be to get lots of ideas from high quality people. Whatever I end up working on I'd want be a cofounder. I think the sense of ownership in a project is core to my happiness./

Liam in five years is a technical expert and is friends with people of high quality.

I'm excited about this. This life seems awesome and attainable if I work hard.

*Here's what I need to be a technical expert:*
- Be a 10x full stack web developer (MERN)
- Stay on the cutting edge of machine learning

*Here's what I need to become close friends with people of high quality:*
- Be confidant. If I want to be friends with someone initiate contact.
- Value intelligence. Doesn't matter if they're not a 'technical' person. Intelligence should be the primary filter.
- Invest deeply. Spend lots of time with people, but only those who are worth it. Think about if this person could still be a close friend in 5 years.
- Be fun to be around. Add energy in any social setting and leave the other person feeling happy.
- Activate experiences. Make stories happen that wouldn't have without me.
- Add value to others. Challenge people to become better versions of themselves and give them honest feedback.
- Be a trustworthy person. Don't talk shit about other people. Be vulnerable and open with people I want to be close to.
- Be smart and opinionated. Introduce people to new ideas and make connections between concepts.

*In the coming months here's what I'll be working on to become this person:*
- Build full stack projects with MERN that have clear utility.
- Build a B2C SaaS website that has 1000+ MAU
- Deploy ML applications (e.g. mobile version of Needle, Zilic at SickKids)
- Read a lot more articles and books. Make TLDRs of these.
- Spend more time thinking and journaling. 
- Practice being opinionated with people on things I've thought a lot about.
- Go to the gym, sleep, and eat well. Make sure I'm always high energy.
- Activate something unexpected any time I hangout with someone.
- Talk to random people on the TTC and at work once a day.

I'm the only thing in life I have full control of. Might as well be awesome.

*** TLDR: Advice for Young INTJs

*Be Strategic*

Strategy is, in essence, the ability to make decisions about how to use limited resources to create relative advantages. Develop this skill by thinking in patterns and their connections and outcomes.

As an introvert haging out in groups drains your batteries. Only engage with people who are worth it. Don't make useless friends.

Live strategically, don't just think strategically. When you decide to do something put all your effort in and use the system effectively.

*Systems and Frameworks*

Systems and frameworks allow you to see the bigger picture. Systems keep you productive by preventing you from being overwhelmed. Frameworks help keep your thoughts structured and find patterns.

Learn lots of things. Read more, research more, dig deeper into everything. Systems thinking will allow you synthesize all this information and form new connections.

*Use Systems Thinking to Find What's Valuable*

Why is your project at work valuable? Why do some people enjoy spending time with you? Dig several levels deep into the system to find how to add value to others.

*Look for Intersections*

The ability to understand complex systems allows you to find intersections between them. Practice this skill a lot.

Whenever you want something to work on, don't look for single threads. Everyone can do that. Intersecting complex systems makes you valuable.

*Everthing is a Case Study*

Every life experience can be used to gain a better understanding of current systems, patterns, and interactions. Trace back through the system to find inefficiencies.

*Seek Discomfort*

If you find yourself insecure about something it's because you don't understand the system, and therefore aren't good at it. Learn the system and patterns that govern it.

*Your Life is a System*

Reflect on your habits, patterns, and routine. and find ways to improve it.

*If you've been procrastinating for most of the day:*
1. Accept that you won't do anything today, and don't get angry at yourself
2. Set an alarm for when you'll prep for bed
3. Procrastinate for the rest of the day
4. When the alarm rings pack your laptop and everything else you need for work in your backpack
5. When you wake up leave the house immediately with your backpack
6. Go to a library, caffe, or other place to GSD
7. Return home in the evening

*Context intentionality as the difference home and every other place on earth*
- Home is the default place. You're more likely to think "I should do something right now" rather than "I should get XYZ done"
- Always work outside of home. Go to caffes, universities, libraries - as long as you haven't been unproductive in that place before.
- To reinforce this mindset forbid yourself from doing anything productive at home.

*Pomodoro v2*
- Set a timer to work on something for 25 minutes, with no distractions. After the timer goes off take a 5 minute break. One cycle of this is called a pomo.
- Every 6 pomos (3 hours) of this take a 35 minute break
- Don't care about doing full pomos. If it's 11:07 get started immediately and set a pomo.
- If you get distracted, don't reset the pomo.
- If you're in the flow, don't feel like you have to take a break.
- If you finish a task in the middle of a pomo, immediately start the next task.
- During short breaks only non-distractive stuff is allowed (i.e. email, reddit, slack are banned)
- If you're not excited about working on anything, use an online RNG to choose your task; preventing you from choosing the easiest tasks first.

Navid Nathoo is the founder of The Knowledge Society, a human accelerator for teenagers. Here's some advice he wished he had when he was younger.

*At a Glance*
- Understand yourself
- Have an active mindset
- Be a good person
- Be happy
 
*Understand yourself*
Most people don't do this, despite being stuck with yourself is one of the few constants in life. Spend more time thinking and introspecting. Don't always be doing.

Write down a list of:
- What you’re good at 
- What you’re not good at
- What you enjoy
- What you don’t enjoy and doesn’t give you value 
- People you like being around and help you grow 
- People that hinder your growth

Sounds obvious, but odds are you'll learn something by actually doing this.

From here start brainstorming 5 year goals that you're excited just thinking about, and that align with who you are.

*Have an active mindeset*
You understand who your are and what you want, now make it happen. It's easy to just let things happen to you, but you'll be much happier if you make things, career / friends / habits, dependant on you.

Work backwards from your 5 year and think what you'll need to have done in the next 3 years, year, 3 months, and 3 weeks to get there. Now hustle to make those things happen.

*Be a good person*
A lot of this boils down to not taking short term gain for yourself or one group at the expense of somebody else.
- Don’t talk shit
- Don’t make jokes about people
- Do nice things.
  - Talk to the lonely person
  - Stop people from making fun of others
  - Help people who need it without expecting anything in return

*Be happy*
Life is made of moments. Make sure you enjoy them. 

Time is your most valuable resource. Don't spend it being stressed. Happiness is a choice and a skill.
