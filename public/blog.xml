Be Strategic
Strategy is, in essence, the ability to make decisions about how to use limited resources to create relative advantages. Develop this skill by thinking in patterns and their connections and outcomes.
As an introvert haging out in groups drains your batteries. Only engage with people who are worth it. Don&amp;rsquo;t make useless friends.
Live strategically, don&amp;rsquo;t just think strategically. When you decide to do something put all your effort in and use the system effectively.</description>

      <description>Until today I didn&amp;rsquo;t have an answer.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a clear idea of what I was working towards in life. What did I want to acheive, what kind of person did I want to become? It felt like I was lost, driving without a destination.
