<p>Navid Nathoo is the founder of The Knowledge Society, a human accelerator for teenagers. Here&rsquo;s some advice he wished he had when he was younger.</p>

<p><strong>At a Glance</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Understand yourself</li>
<li>Have an active mindset</li>
<li>Be a good person</li>
<li>Be happy</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Understand yourself</strong>
Most people don&rsquo;t do this, despite being stuck with yourself is one of the few constants in life. Spend more time thinking and introspecting. Don&rsquo;t always be doing.</p>

<p>Write down a list of:</p>

<ul>
<li>What you’re good at</li>
<li>What you’re not good at</li>
<li>What you enjoy</li>
<li>What you don’t enjoy and doesn’t give you value</li>
<li>People you like being around and help you grow</li>
<li>People that hinder your growth</li>
</ul>

<p>Sounds obvious, but odds are you&rsquo;ll learn something by actually doing this.</p>

<p>From here start brainstorming 5 year goals that you&rsquo;re excited just thinking about, and that align with who you are.</p>

<p><strong>Have an active mindeset</strong>
You understand who your are and what you want, now make it happen. It&rsquo;s easy to just let things happen to you, but you&rsquo;ll be much happier if you make things, career / friends / habits, dependant on you.</p>

<p>Work backwards from your 5 year and think what you&rsquo;ll need to have done in the next 3 years, year, 3 months, and 3 weeks to get there. Now hustle to make those things happen.</p>

<p><strong>Be a good person</strong>
A lot of this boils down to not taking short term gain for yourself or one group at the expense of somebody else.</p>

<ul>
<li>Don’t talk shit</li>
<li>Don’t make jokes about people</li>
<li>Do nice things.

<ul>
<li>Talk to the lonely person</li>
<li>Stop people from making fun of others</li>
<li>Help people who need it without expecting anything in return</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Be happy</strong>
Life is made of moments. Make sure you enjoy them.</p>

<p>Time is your most valuable resource. Don&rsquo;t spend it being stressed. Happiness is a choice and a skill.</p>
