<p>I didn&rsquo;t have a clear idea of what I was working towards in life. What did I want to acheive, what kind of person did I want to become? It felt like I was lost, driving without a destination.</p>

<p>I spent some time introspecting, here&rsquo;s my answer:</p>

<p><em>In five years I want to be the guy you go to if you have an awesome idea and need it built. I want to build something that’s impactful and interesting technically. Right now I don’t generate great ideas, so the best way to find something meaningful to work on seems to be to get lots of ideas from high quality people. Whatever I end up working on I&rsquo;d want be a cofounder. I think the sense of ownership in a project is core to my happiness.</em></p>

<p>Liam in five years is a technical expert and is friends with people of high quality.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited about this. This life seems awesome and attainable if I work hard.</p>

<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s what I need to be a technical expert:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Be a 10x full stack web developer (MERN)</li>
<li>Stay on the cutting edge of machine learning</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s what I need to become close friends with people of high quality:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Be confidant. If I want to be friends with someone initiate contact.</li>
<li>Value intelligence. Doesn&rsquo;t matter if they&rsquo;re not a &lsquo;technical&rsquo; person. Intelligence should be the primary filter.</li>
<li>Invest deeply. Spend lots of time with people, but only those who are worth it. Think about if this person could still be a close friend in 5 years.</li>
<li>Be fun to be around. Add energy in any social setting and leave the other person feeling happy.</li>
<li>Activate experiences. Make stories happen that wouldn&rsquo;t have without me.</li>
<li>Add value to others. Challenge people to become better versions of themselves and give them honest feedback.</li>
<li>Be a trustworthy person. Don&rsquo;t talk shit about other people. Be vulnerable and open with people I want to be close to.</li>
<li>Be smart and opinionated. Introduce people to new ideas and make connections between concepts.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>In the coming months here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll be working on to become this person:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Build full stack projects with MERN that have clear utility.</li>
<li>Build a B2C SaaS website that has 1000+ MAU</li>
<li>Deploy ML applications (e.g. mobile version of Needle, Zilic at SickKids)</li>
<li>Read a lot more articles and books. Make TLDRs of these.</li>
<li>Spend more time thinking and journaling.</li>
<li>Practice being opinionated with people on things I&rsquo;ve thought a lot about.</li>
<li>Go to the gym, sleep, and eat well. Make sure I&rsquo;m always high energy.</li>
<li>Activate something unexpected any time I hangout with someone.</li>
<li>Talk to random people on the TTC and at work once a day.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m the only thing in life I have full control of. Might as well be awesome.</p>
