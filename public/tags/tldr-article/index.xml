Be Strategic
Strategy is, in essence, the ability to make decisions about how to use limited resources to create relative advantages. Develop this skill by thinking in patterns and their connections and outcomes.
As an introvert haging out in groups drains your batteries. Only engage with people who are worth it. Don&amp;rsquo;t make useless friends.
Live strategically, don&amp;rsquo;t just think strategically. When you decide to do something put all your effort in and use the system effectively.</description>
