**If you've been procrastinating for most of the day:**

1.  Accept that you won't do anything today, and don't get angry at yourself
2.  Set an alarm for when you'll prep for bed
3.  Procrastinate for the rest of the day
4.  When the alarm rings pack your laptop and everything else you need for work in your backpack
5.  When you wake up leave the house immediately with your backpack
6.  Go to a library, caffe, or other place to GSD
7.  Return home in the evening

**Context intentionality as the difference home and every other place on earth**

-   Home is the default place. You're more likely to think "I should do something right now" rather than "I should get XYZ done"
-   Always work outside of home. Go to caffes, universities, libraries - as long as you haven't been unproductive in that place before.
-   To reinforce this mindset forbid yourself from doing anything productive at home.

**Pomodoro v2**

-   Set a timer to work on something for 25 minutes, with no distractions. After the timer goes off take a 5 minute break. One cycle of this is called a pomo.
-   Every 6 pomos (3 hours) of this take a 35 minute break
-   Don't care about doing full pomos. If it's 11:07 get started immediately and set a pomo.
-   If you get distracted, don't reset the pomo.
-   If you're in the flow, don't feel like you have to take a break.
-   If you finish a task in the middle of a pomo, immediately start the next task.
-   During short breaks only non-distractive stuff is allowed (i.e. email, reddit, slack are banned)
-   If you're not excited about working on anything, use an online RNG to choose your task; preventing you from choosing the easiest tasks first.
