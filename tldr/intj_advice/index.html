<p><strong>Be Strategic</strong></p>

<p>Strategy is, in essence, the ability to make decisions about how to use limited resources to create relative advantages. Develop this skill by thinking in patterns and their connections and outcomes.</p>

<p>As an introvert haging out in groups drains your batteries. Only engage with people who are worth it. Don&rsquo;t make useless friends.</p>

<p>Live strategically, don&rsquo;t just think strategically. When you decide to do something put all your effort in and use the system effectively.</p>

<p><strong>Systems and Frameworks</strong></p>

<p>Systems and frameworks allow you to see the bigger picture. Systems keep you productive by preventing you from being overwhelmed. Frameworks help keep your thoughts structured and find patterns.</p>

<p>Learn lots of things. Read more, research more, dig deeper into everything. Systems thinking will allow you synthesize all this information and form new connections.</p>

<p><strong>Use Systems Thinking to Find What&rsquo;s Valuable</strong></p>

<p>Why is your project at work valuable? Why do some people enjoy spending time with you? Dig several levels deep into the system to find how to add value to others.</p>

<p><strong>Look for Intersections</strong></p>

<p>The ability to understand complex systems allows you to find intersections between them. Practice this skill a lot.</p>

<p>Whenever you want something to work on, don&rsquo;t look for single threads. Everyone can do that. Intersecting complex systems makes you valuable.</p>

<p><strong>Everthing is a Case Study</strong></p>

<p>Every life experience can be used to gain a better understanding of current systems, patterns, and interactions. Trace back through the system to find inefficiencies.</p>

<p><strong>Seek Discomfort</strong></p>

<p>If you find yourself insecure about something it&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t understand the system, and therefore aren&rsquo;t good at it. Learn the system and patterns that govern it.</p>

<p><strong>Your Life is a System</strong></p>

<p>Reflect on your habits, patterns, and routine. and find ways to improve it.</p>
