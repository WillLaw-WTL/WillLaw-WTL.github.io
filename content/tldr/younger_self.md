Navid Nathoo is the founder of The Knowledge Society, a human accelerator for teenagers. Here's some advice he wished he had when he was younger.

**At a Glance**

-   Understand yourself
-   Have an active mindset
-   Be a good person
-   Be happy

**Understand yourself**
Most people don't do this, despite being stuck with yourself is one of the few constants in life. Spend more time thinking and introspecting. Don't always be doing.

Write down a list of:

-   What you’re good at
-   What you’re not good at
-   What you enjoy
-   What you don’t enjoy and doesn’t give you value
-   People you like being around and help you grow
-   People that hinder your growth

Sounds obvious, but odds are you'll learn something by actually doing this.

From here start brainstorming 5 year goals that you're excited just thinking about, and that align with who you are.

**Have an active mindeset**
You understand who your are and what you want, now make it happen. It's easy to just let things happen to you, but you'll be much happier if you make things, career / friends / habits, dependant on you.

Work backwards from your 5 year and think what you'll need to have done in the next 3 years, year, 3 months, and 3 weeks to get there. Now hustle to make those things happen.

**Be a good person**
A lot of this boils down to not taking short term gain for yourself or one group at the expense of somebody else.

-   Don’t talk shit
-   Don’t make jokes about people
-   Do nice things.
    -   Talk to the lonely person
    -   Stop people from making fun of others
    -   Help people who need it without expecting anything in return

**Be happy**
Life is made of moments. Make sure you enjoy them.

Time is your most valuable resource. Don't spend it being stressed. Happiness is a choice and a skill.
