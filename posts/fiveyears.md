Until today I didn't have an answer.

I didn't have a clear idea of what I was working towards in life. What did I want to acheive, what kind of person did I want to become? It felt like I was lost, driving without a destination.

I spent some time introspecting, here's my answer:

_In five years I want to be the guy you go to if you have an awesome idea and need it built. I want to build something that’s impactful and interesting technically. Right now I don’t generate great ideas, so the best way to find something meaningful to work on seems to be to get lots of ideas from high quality people. Whatever I end up working on I'd want be a cofounder. I think the sense of ownership in a project is core to my happiness._

Liam in five years is a technical expert and is friends with people of high quality.

I'm excited about this. This life seems awesome and attainable if I work hard.

**Here's what I need to be a technical expert:**

-   Be a 10x full stack web developer (MERN)
-   Stay on the cutting edge of machine learning

**Here's what I need to become close friends with people of high quality:**

-   Be confidant. If I want to be friends with someone initiate contact.
-   Value intelligence. Doesn't matter if they're not a 'technical' person. Intelligence should be the primary filter.
-   Invest deeply. Spend lots of time with people, but only those who are worth it. Think about if this person could still be a close friend in 5 years.
-   Be fun to be around. Add energy in any social setting and leave the other person feeling happy.
-   Activate experiences. Make stories happen that wouldn't have without me.
-   Add value to others. Challenge people to become better versions of themselves and give them honest feedback.
-   Be a trustworthy person. Don't talk shit about other people. Be vulnerable and open with people I want to be close to.
-   Be smart and opinionated. Introduce people to new ideas and make connections between concepts.

**In the coming months here's what I'll be working on to become this person:**

-   Build full stack projects with MERN that have clear utility.
-   Build a B2C SaaS website that has 1000+ MAU
-   Deploy ML applications (e.g. mobile version of Needle, Zilic at SickKids)
-   Read a lot more articles and books. Make TLDRs of these.
-   Spend more time thinking and journaling.
-   Practice being opinionated with people on things I've thought a lot about.
-   Go to the gym, sleep, and eat well. Make sure I'm always high energy.
-   Activate something unexpected any time I hangout with someone.
-   Talk to random people on the TTC and at work once a day.

I'm the only thing in life I have full control of. Might as well be awesome.
